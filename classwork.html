<td>In HTML, creating a paragraph is simple as entering text. To create a paragraph, move the cursor to the location 
where you want the paragraph in the HTML editor you are using. Next, type the <p> tag to begin the paragraph. (Yes, 
if you guessed, the "p" inside the <p> tag stands for paragraph.) Once you are done typing or pasting text for the 
paragraph, close the <p> tag with </p>. Closing the tag instructs the browser that the paragraph has ended.<hr></td>

<td>Far too many diseases do not have a proven means of prevention, or effective treatment. We must gain better insights
 into the biological, environmental, and behavioral influences on these diseases to make a difference for the millions of
 people who suffer from them. Precision medicine is a revolutionary approach for disease prevention and treatment that 
 takes into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology. While some advances in precision
 medicine have been made, the practice is not currently in use for most diseases.</tr>

<td>Did you know the word essay is derived from a Latin word 
exagium, which roughly translates to presenting one’s case? So essays are a short piece of writing representing one’s side
 of the argument or one’s experiences, stories etc. Essays are very personalized. So let us learn about types of essays, format,
 and tips for essay-writing.</td><td>An essay is generally a short piece of writing outlining the writer’s perspective or story.
 It is often considered synonymous with a story or a paper or an article. Essays can be both formal as well as informal. Formal 
 essays are generally academic in nature and tackle serious topics. We will be focusing on informal essays which are more personal
 and often have humorous elements.</td><td>Narrative Essays: This is when the writer is narrating an incident or story through the essay
  these are in the first person. The aim when writing narrative essays is to involve the reader in them 
as if they were right there when it was happening. SO make them as vivid and real as possible. One to make this possible is to follow
 the principle of show, don’t tell. So you must involve the reader
in the story.</td>
<td>Descriptive Essays: Here the writer will describe a place, an object, an event or maybe even a memory.
But it is not just plainly describing things. The writer must paint a picture through his words. One clever
way to do that is to evoke the senses of the reader. Do not only rely on sight but also involve the other 
senses of smell, touch, sound etc. A descriptive essay when done well will make the reader feel the emotions
the writer was feeling at the moment.
